   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**
   Install the MySQL Connector library using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install mysql-connector-python
   ```

3. **Set Up the MySQL Database**
   - Create a database in MySQL named `Ak1`:
     ```sql

     );
     ```

4. **Update Database Credentials**
   Open the Python script and update the following section with your MySQL credentials:
   ```python
   mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
       host="localhost",
       user="root",
       password="your_password",
       database="Ak1"
   )
   ```

5. **Run the Application**
   Execute the script in your terminal:
